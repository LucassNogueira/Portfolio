# Blog Content Migration Guide

This guide will help you add markdown content to your blog posts in Supabase.

## What Was Changed

1. ‚úÖ Added `content` column to the `blog_posts` table schema
2. ‚úÖ Updated TypeScript types to include optional `content` field
3. ‚úÖ Updated Supabase API to fetch content
4. ‚úÖ Updated blog page to display content from Supabase
5. ‚úÖ Created migration script to read markdown files and upload content

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Run the SQL Migration

Go to your Supabase Dashboard:
1. Open **SQL Editor**
2. Copy and paste the contents of: `supabase/migrations/002_add_blog_content.sql`
3. Click **Run**

This will add the `content` column to your `blog_posts` table.

### 2. Update Existing Blog Posts with Content

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm run update:blog-content
```

This will:
- Read the markdown files from `src/content/blog/`
- Update each blog post in Supabase with its content
- Show you a summary of what was updated

### 3. Verify in Supabase

Go to **Table Editor** ‚Üí **blog_posts** and check that your posts now have content.

### 4. Test Locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit a blog post (e.g., `/blog/nuqs-modal-state-hooks`) and you should see the full markdown content rendered.

### 5. Deploy

Once everything looks good:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "Add blog content to Supabase"
git push
```

## Expected Output

When you run `npm run update:blog-content`, you should see:

```

## Troubleshooting

**Error: "Missing Supabase environment variables"**
- Make sure your `.env.local` file has `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

**Error: "markdown file not found"**
- Check that your markdown files are in `src/content/blog/` with the correct slug names

**Empty content on blog page**
- Verify the SQL migration ran successfully
- Check that the update script completed without errors
- Refresh your browser cache

## What Happens in Production

- Your blog pages use Edge Runtime (Cloudflare compatible)
- Content is fetched from Supabase at runtime
- No filesystem operations needed
- Fast, cached responses
